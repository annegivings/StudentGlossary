# StudentGlossary
A template for a glossary of HTML &amp; CSS tags and usage information to share with students so they can build their knowledge bank as they are building their first websites.  

The .html file includes the template (which students have access to and can edit) while the .css file has the styling (namely what color the tags should be and other limited styling choices).
