<table border="1">
  <th class="tags">Tag</th>
  <th>Meaning and Usage</th>
  <tr>
    <td class="tags">&ltp&gt</td>
    <td>This tag is used to create a paragraph.  For example: <p>&ltp&gtThis is a paragraph.&ltp&gt</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tags">&lth1&gt</td>
    <td>This is used to create a heading.  Heading sizes get smaller as the number goes up.  While &lth1&gt is the largest, &lth6&gt is the smallest. Examples:
      <h1>&lth1&gtLarge Heading&lth1&gt</h1>
      <h3>&lth3&gtMedium Heading&lth3&gt</h3>
      <h6>&lth6&gtSmall Heading&lth6&gt</h6>
    </td>
  </tr>

<p><strong>Instructions: </strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Each tag should get its own row complete with a meaning and example of usage</li>
    <li> To input the &lt or &gt symbols, type "& l t" together to open and "& g t" to close.</li>
    <li>Input data based on order of importance.  If you decide to add something and you think it's more important than the &lth1&gt tag, put it above.  Each new tag requires a table row (&lttr&gt) and two sets of table data (&lttd&gt), the first being the tag and the second being the data/usage.</li>
    <li>This is <strong><span>your<span></strong> glossary.  Add anything you find yourself constantly looking up.  Don't add things that aren't important to you.
